      "in my experience, it depends on the server and the time of day. they do not seem to manage busy times well, for example: tonight we had a reservation for 6 at 8pm. it was 8:20 before we were seated and the device did not get better from there. some small mistakes in our orders were made, but everyone makes mistakes. we asked to split the check between 2 cards and the totals were drastically different and more than the total bill (in favor of the restaurant) . our server was nowhere to be found so we tracked someone else down to fix it (who was very nice) . the food is good, but it is not really worth the poor service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                15\n",
      "i will never, ever, in my whole life, understand why people love this restaurant so much. i walk by often and see a lots of nj plates using the valet service so it is gotta be the tourists (and my co workers that live in the suburbs they like ralph's, but you should see what they eat for lunch every day if you know what i mean.) i suspect that the suburban folks are at a disadvantage by only having an olive garden to compare authentic italian food to so ralph's probably seems like some freaky cheese covered upgrade. anyway, back to ralph's, sure, it is been there for over a hundred years, the decor is cute on the first floor, reminding one of the olden days . sure, the service is cheeky if not just a little snarky, but the food is downright terrible. okay. it is edible, but not edible in a good way. the last time i was there was for a wedding rehearsal dinner and no one finished their entrees & when asked by the waitress if anyone wanted it wrapped up to take home it was a unanimous, no. this was from roughly around, oh, 100 people. that is a bad thing.    15\n",
      "i enjoy most of the food and the delivery is quick. the prices are great and the food is also good. but when i order my food, i noticed they do not provide napkins even if you ask. so today when i placed my lunch order, i decided to ask again, and the gentleman that took the order actually said no we do not provide napkins now to me that is crazy. the company i work for thats located only minutes away gives them a lot of business daily. that is not a good answer telling a customer that you do not provide napkins. omg that is crazy!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        14\n",
